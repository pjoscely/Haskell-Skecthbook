"Grothendieck describes two styles in mathematics. If you think of a theorem to
be proved as a nut to be opened, so as to reach “the nourishing flesh protected by
the shell”, then the hammer and chisel principle is: “put the cutting edge of the
chisel against the shell and strike hard. If needed, begin again at many different
points until the shell cracks—and you are satisfied”. 

He says:
I can illustrate the second approach with the same image of a
nut to be opened. The first analogy that came to my mind is of
immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply
water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better,
and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible
through weeks and months—when the time is ripe, hand pressure
is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado!
A different image came to me a few weeks ago. The unknown
thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or
hard marl, resisting penetration. . . the sea advances insensibly in
silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so
far off you hardly hear it. . . yet it finally surrounds the resistant
substance."
